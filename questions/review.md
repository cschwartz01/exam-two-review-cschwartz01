## Technical Review

### Review the Python functions from assignments and notes

TODO: To assist in studying, it is recommended to:

- Review chapters 5-10
- Review course [notes in course-materials repo](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-101-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/Schedule.md)
- Review [Proactive Programmers Slides](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/schedule-data-abstraction/)
- Hand write definitions to terminology
- Hand write short code snippets that exemplify terminology 
- Ask questions if you have them on Discord in the #data-abstraction channel

#### Provide the first recursive Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Provide the second recursive Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Provide the third recursive Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Using a previously provided function, provide Python code to show how to call it

#### Write two test functions for a function above

#### Write a function that directly modifies a list

#### Write a list comprehension

#### Write an import statement from a package

#### Add a counter to a recursive function

#### Create simple class

## Learning Objectives

TODO: Review the learning objectives at [Learning Objectives for Data
Abstraction
structures](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/data-abstraction/learning-objectives-data-abstraction/)
and then use the following instructions to complete the next questions.

### Record three learning objectives for which you judge you can demonstrate mastery of the technical knowledge or skill

#### Restate the first learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the second learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the third learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the last module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge
TODO: When you are writing your response to this question, please follow this template:

When I was working on `fill in the name of a project`, I made a mistake when I
`explain details about the mistake`. I did not understand `explain what you did
not understand`. Now I know `explain what you know`. I revealed the gap in my
understanding by `explain what steps you took to identify the gap`. Now I know
`explain what you now know`. To demonstrate my improved understanding, I will
`explain what steps you will take now that you understand the learning
objective`.

### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated technical skill

## Review Checklist

TODO: Please create a filled checkbox for each review task that you completed:

- [] Re-read all of the content in the covered chapters of the course textbooks
- [] Studied and executed all of the Python source code in the Jupyter notebooks
- [] Correctly answered all of the summary questions in the Jupyter notebooks
- [] Reviewed and understood all of the technical content in the course slides
- [] Completed all source code surveys, programming projects, and engineering efforts
- [] Confirmed that you have a passing build in all of the aforementioned projects
- [] Answered all of the questions in the proactive review document

TODO: If you have questions or concerns about content in this module that you
could not resolve after completing the proactive review, you should take these steps:

- [] Post questions to a public channel in Discord for any unresolved issues
- [] Schedule office hours with the course instructor to discuss any unresolved issues
